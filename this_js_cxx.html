<h2><code>this</code>: C++ vs JavaScript</h2>
<p>
	As a quick google search for "this javascript" will show you, the <code>this</code> keyword is an unending source of
	confusion in JavaScript. Meanwhile in C++, the <code>this</code> keyword causes hardly any confusion, even though it
	works almost the exact same way!
</p>
<h3>Wait, WHAT!?</h3>
<p>Yup, the <code>this</code> keyword behaves very similarly in C++ and JavaScript.</p>
