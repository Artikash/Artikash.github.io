<h2>Dictionaries for Textractor</h2>
<p>Textractor uses a custom dictionary format which was designed to be efficient and easy to parse for Textractor
	(dictionaries are normally stored in other formats which are superior in many other ways). The dictionaries on this
	page are in Textractor's format, but they were all generated by converting a dictionary from another format. All
	credit for the contents of these dictionaries belongs to the people/organizations that originally made them. I only
	take credit for the scripts that were used to convert the dictionaries. The scripts are made available here under
	the terms of the <a href="https://unlicense.org/">Unlicense</a>.</p>
