<h2>Immediately Invoked Lambda Expressions in C++</h2>
<h3>WIP</h3>
<p>My journey as a programmer is long, but the important part of it for today is that I spent a long time working with
	web front-ends i.e. JavaScript, but recently have been making a fairly complex C++ desktop app.
</p>
<p>As such, I use a technique in my C++ that is used and talked about all the time in JavaScript, but seems to not be so
	in C++.</p>
<p>Before I explain it, you should know the problem that it solves.</p>
<code>class Foo
{
public:
	Foo(int bar) :
		cbar{ /*???*/ }
	{}
private:
	const int cbar;
};</code>
<p>When writing the constructor of class <code>Foo</code>, <code>cbar</code> must be initialized in the initializer list
	because it's <code>const</code>.
	The problem is that initializer lists may only contain expressions, not statements. If the initialization code needs
	multiple statements, you're fucked!
