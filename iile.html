<h2>Immediately Invoked Lambda Expressions (IILEs) in C++</h2>
<p>
	My journey as a programmer is long, but the important part of it for today is that I spent a long time working with
	web front-ends i.e. JavaScript, but recently have been making a fairly complex C++ desktop app.
</p>
<p>
	As such, I use a technique in my C++ that is used and talked about all the time in JavaScript, but seems to not be
	so in C++.
</p>
<p>Before I explain it, you should know the problem that it solves.</p>
<pre><code>class foo
{
public:
	foo(int bar) :
		m_bar{ bar != 0 ? bar : ((std::cin >> bar), bar) }
	{}
private:
	const int m_bar;
};</code></pre>
<p>
	When writing the constructor of class <code>foo</code>, <code>m_bar</code> must be initialized in the initializer
	list because it's <code>const</code>. The problem is that initializer lists may only contain expressions, not
	statements. If the initialization code needs multiple statements, you're fucked! In the example above, even though
	it can technically be done, it's definitely not something you want in your codebase. And you can easily imagine
	situations where it gets much uglier or is impossible (most notably, if you want to create temporary variables to
	store the results of intermediate computations). Of course, you could define a helper function instead, but then
	it's very annoying to use variables that are only in scope at the call site. Also you now have to name it, and
	naming things is hard.
</p>
<p>This is where Immediately Invoked Lambda Expressions come in:</p>
<pre><code>class foo
{
public:
	foo(int bar) :
		m_bar{ [&]
			{
				if (bar != 0) return bar;
				int input;
				std::cin >> input;
				return input;
			}()
		}
	{}
private:
	const int m_bar;
};</code></pre>
<p>
	The great thing about lambdas is that defining and calling them is considered a single expression. It is thus
	possible to use multiple statements in the initialization of <code>m_bar</code>. Once you've gotten used to this
	technique (which will happen almost instantly), it can greatly improve the clarity of your code as well as being
	outright more powerful/flexible than whatever horrifying amalgamation of comma operators you might use before.
</p>
<p>
	Of course, initializer lists aren't the only location where it's useful to convert statement(s) to an expression.
	There are many situations in C++ where you must supply one expression, and IILEs can be useful in all of them.
</p>
<p>
	One annoying thing about C++ is that you have to go to the end of the lambda and check for the parentheses to know
	if it's being immediately invoked or not (as opposed to JavaScript, where <code>(function ...</code> is a dead
	giveaway for an IIFE). To alleviate this, you can use <code>std::invoke</code> like
	<code>std::invoke([&] { ... })</code>. This shows at the start that the lambda will be invoked immediately, but will
	increase your compile times. Whether that's worth it is up to you.
